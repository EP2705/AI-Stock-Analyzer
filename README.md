# AI Financial Research Assistant

This is a web application that combines traditional stock chart analysis with an AI-powered research assistant. Users can input a stock ticker to visualize its historical price and key moving averages, and then ask the integrated AI agent questions about the company, market conditions, and whether to invest. The agent uses live web search to provide up-to-date, summarized answers.
